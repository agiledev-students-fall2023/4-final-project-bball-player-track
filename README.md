# BBall Player Tracker

## Overview
This project is a MERN stack web application which will allow users to access basketball statistics from current NBA games as well as an archive of past statistics. Statistics will be up-to-date and presented in a visually satisfying manner, and users will be able to customize their experience by choosing favorite players or team. 

## Product Vision Statement
Our vision is to create a basketball statistics app which is fun and easy to use and provides all of the necessary data in a streamlined and visually appealing way. We envision a user experience geared towards passionate NBA fans who love basketball and want to dig deeper, and our app will enhance the viewing experience for these fans by giving them quick access to the statistics they want, without unnecessary distractions.
